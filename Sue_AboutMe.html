          <p>I am a high schooler that is interested in coding. I know how to do HTML and CSS. I am currently learning how to do python. I have worked with multiple people on different coding projects.
            I have many activities that I enjoy doing, such as drawing and gaming. I like to draw my own kinds of characters, but I sometimes recreate some characters, since I sometimes get bored trying to brainstorm ideas for an original character. This is only one of the many things that I enjoy doing.
            I usually prioritize doing work first before doing other things, since I like having the feeling of releif of being done with a task. I don't rush through it either, I try to do the best I can on what I have to do along with getting it done.
            I have practiced swimming and sometimes badminton. I don't do either much anymore, but I still remember how to do certain movements if I try.
